### File Description: 

**ISMEJ_FFS_RawData.csv**

Two "Symbiont" strains were used in this experiment: C - Cladocopium goreaui, D - Durusdinium trenchii. 

Experimental treatments include "Temp" (temperatures: 26 and 32 ÂºC) and "Comp" (competition: Yes or No). 

"Treatment" incorporates both the symbiont strain (C/D) and the competition treatment ("only" = No, "mix" = yes)

"Sorting" indicates whether samples were subjected to FISH labelling and Flow Cytometry (Yes) or analysed by stable isotope analysis directly (No). 

Raw Data are reported as atom% (AP) of the heavy isotope ("AP15N" & "AP13C"). These are measured with EA-IRMS and are calculated by the count of the heavy isotope relative to the total number of atoms of N or C in the sample (see source paper for further details). "CN" is calculated from the ratio of AP13C:AP15N.
